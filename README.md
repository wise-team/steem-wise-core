# Steem smartvotes (core package)
Vote delegation system for STEEM blockchain: core package.

Currently, there are two tools available:

- [steem-smartvotes-cli](https://github.com/Jblew/steem-smartvotes-cli) — CLI tool for vote delegators
- [steem-smartvotes-voter-page](https://github.com/Jblew/steem-smartvotes-voter-page) — Simple HTML page that allows a voter to vote on behalf of a delegator. 




##What will smartvotes do for the community?

An ultimate cure for cancer was the biggest holy grail of medicine for decades. However time has shown, that instead of ultimate cure, there are many potent, but narrow-targeted drugs. So are counter-abuse mechanisms in Steem network. 

One of biggest advantages of steem is that it utilizes human resources to distinguish between good and bad content. People are encouraged to vote and flag by financial reward. It is designed to resist most of the abuses, however, there are people who somehow try to bend the rules. Moreover, there are users, who, create imprecise and misleading content in professional fields. Even though they do it in a good faith, it is almost impossible for a layman to tell if professionally looking pseudo-scientific article tells the truth or not. Another problem is that it is hard for minnows to join forces in a vote-flag fight with a malicious whale. These are some of the wide variety of steem community problems. Probably there won't by any single tool to treat them all, but as with cancer drugs, there are many wise, narrow-targeted initiatives. Among them the smartvote system is here, to even the odds in a fight with:

- Misleading pseudo-science — by allowing the community to appoint professional authorities to a position of curators in the field of their knowledge
- Abusive whales — through the ability to join forces of many minnows under common leadership




## What will smartvotes do for you (if you are a delegator)?

In steem, the best voting strategy is to vote 10 times per 24 hours. Each vote decreases your voting power by 2%pp (percentage points). Each 24h 20%pp is restored progressively. The best strategy is to oscillate between 80%-100% of VP. To sum up: if you vote more than 10 votes/24h, your VP will not restore to 100%, but if you vote less than 10 times, your VP will only restore to 100% and not higher, so it means that you have wasted your votes. With smartvotes:

- You can delegate a static amount of votes (eg. 150% means 1.5 of full votes or three 50% votes)
- You can delegate static amount of vote, but only in a situation when you have a specific amount of votes still left and it is going to waste.

Smartvotes can also boost your voting earnings: If you delegate your votes to a professional authority it is more likely that the post he will choose will become more popular.
